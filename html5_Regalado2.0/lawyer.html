				A fake card game I made for a final in my Game Studies class. It's a party game that is meant to be played with close friends due to the weird, and sometimes obscene, nature of the prompts on the cards. Each one has a different scenario and character that the player must defend while the rest of the players act as a jury. The better their argument, the more points they get.
