				A small, 15 second repeating video as tribute to one of my favorite games of all time: Bioshock Infinite. It is meant to be visually and audibly jarring. The music is cute and calming, but the clips contrasts this through scenes full of fights, gore and the peril of free falling. It reflects the environment in which Bioshock Infinite takes place, because at face value the city of Columbia is seen as heaven on earth. However, as the story progresses, it's shown that the city is darker than it appears. Bioshock Infinite displays issues of racism, classism, and other immoral things in the name of religion. There is a VHS effect over it all because it is reminiscent of home videos and how people use them to look back on memories. This game is a precious memory for me and looking back on it always makes me feel nostalgic.
